# PSQI-Python

This is a Python script to clean, analyze, and score data from the Pittsburg sleep Quality Index (PSQI) from a Google Forms. 

Score PSQI could take some time, so I wanted to programm something in order to automatize all PSQI responses. 

I first used a google forms template that you'll find in this repository, and then clean all the data from those questions.

Note that the forms is in Spanish, so in order to make the script works make sure you rename the columns in our language. 

Another important point is that I used google colab to show my results in the lab, so choose your favorite way to upload the data.

I hope this script helps you in analyzing your PSQI score faster and better.
